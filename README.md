# Simple-text-editor-with-timestamp
Help! I'm a journalist and I need a text editor with timestamps for Mac.

I'm really not a code writer - I do write but mostly articles for newspapers, as well as I'm doing storys for the radio. Now I need the simples text editor with timestamps, and it would be for Mac. 
Just the normal Text Editor would do fine, but every time I press enter that note would be saves with a timestamp (maybe turn i bit grey or something to show that it's now saved) and if I go back to edit it that would show as well. To keep a log.

Again: I'm not a code writer but I imagine this would not take to much time to put togheter. I can pay (I'm a freelance so not that much, thou) and I'm sure there would be a great market among my fellow journalists. 

If you're interested please write a note here or direct to me at lasse@nagotpahjartat.se

Best,
Lasse
